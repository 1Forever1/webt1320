                    <p>Have you ever thought of yourself as a juggler? In many ways whether young or old we have to learn to balance life with your time managment, consistency, and over all attitude.
                    Each week has 168 hours that can be used wisely or wasted. Writing down what you do hour by hour shows where your time goes and being meticulous on where you spend your time. You want time to benefit you regardless if your a young or older adult.</p>

                    <h2>Being Consistent</h2>
                    <img src="images/key.jpg" alt="key">
                    <p>Developing consistency into your life is just another way of saying having order in your life. We as humans tend to do things in order like, "you wouldn't put your pants on first then your underwear". The way you've developed those skills you got to be diligent in staying consistent with assignments, scheduled meatings, and planning ahead as you do that routine every morning.</p>

                    <img src="images/positive.jpg" alt="positive">
                    <p>Heard the cliche before "I'm not a morning person?" What determines if your not a morning person? In all reality that is an opinion you have created about yourself to excuse your lack of drive for a new day. Everyday that you wake up should be a motivation, Why? "because you woke up that is a blessing". Your additude about "you" will have you win or lose.</p>
